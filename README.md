# Lenins-Bot-Test-Elife
I recommend you to use ngrok to expose your local web server to the internet for testing purposes. In production, in case you want to retake my experiment, you could host this app via Heroku (as I did).

Don't forget to install MongoDB (npm install mongodb) and Watson Developer Cloud (npm install watson-developer-cloud).

app.js -> Initial Facebook code (default)
app2.js -> Lenin's code representing the chatbot used in his PhD
